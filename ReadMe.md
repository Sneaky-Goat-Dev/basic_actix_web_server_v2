Below is a detailed specification that meets your requirements—a base HTTP server in Rust with Postgres integration designed with production readiness in mind. This spec starts simple and then layers in optional features and production‐grade practices. It also includes guidance on project structure.

---

## 1. Base Server Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **Endpoints:**
  - **GET /health**  
    – Returns a simple 200 OK with no body (for basic health checking).
  - **GET /items**  
    – Fetch a list of “items” (or any simple resource) from a Postgres database and return as JSON.
  - **POST /items**  
    – Accept JSON payload to create a new item in the database.
  - _(Optional)_ **PUT/PATCH /items/{id}** and **DELETE /items/{id}**  
    – Update or delete items, respectively.

### Non-Functional (Production) Requirements

- **Concurrency & Performance:**  
  – Use an asynchronous HTTP framework (e.g. [Actix Web](https://actix.rs)) running on the Tokio runtime.  
  – By default, Actix Web spawns one worker per CPU core. You can increase the worker thread count via the `.workers()` method to further exploit parallelism (e.g. 2× cores for I/O-bound workloads).
- **Database Integration:**  
  – Integrate with Postgres (using Diesel or SQLx for ORM/query support).  
  – Implement connection pooling.
- **Containerization:**  
  – The entire service (and its Postgres dependency) must run in Docker (using Docker Compose for multi‑container orchestration).
- **Logging & Monitoring:**  
  – Built-in logging via Actix’s Logger middleware (integrated with `env_logger` or similar).  
  – Optionally, expose metrics (e.g. Prometheus-compatible endpoints).
- **Security & Robustness:**  
  – Support TLS/HTTPS (using rustls or OpenSSL integration).  
  – Input validation and sanitation on all endpoints.  
  – Robust error handling with clear error messages and proper HTTP status codes.
- **Configuration:**  
  – Use environment variables (with .env support) for configuration such as port, database URL, TLS settings, etc.

## 2. Optional (Production‑Grade) Features

- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  – Implement JWT-based or Basic Auth middleware to protect sensitive endpoints.
- **Rate Limiting:**  
  – Add middleware for per-IP or per-user rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- **API Documentation:**  
  – Auto‑generate API docs (e.g. OpenAPI/Swagger) from your route definitions.
- **Graceful Shutdown & Health Checks:**  
  – Implement graceful shutdown logic to drain in‑flight requests.  
  – Extend health checks to include database connectivity, TLS certificate validity, and other dependencies.
- **Caching:**  
  – Integrate a caching layer (in‑memory or via Redis) for high‑frequency read endpoints.
- **Advanced Logging/Tracing:**  
  – Use structured logging (e.g. with the `tracing` crate) and possibly distributed tracing for deeper insight in production.

## 3. Technology Stack

- **Language & Runtime:** Rust with the Tokio async runtime.
- **HTTP Framework:** Actix Web (or an alternative like Warp or Axum if you prefer a different style).
- **Database:** Postgres, using Diesel or SQLx as the database layer.
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose.
- **Logging & Monitoring:** env_logger/tracing, with optional Prometheus integration.

## 4. Suggested Project Structure

Organize your project for maintainability and testability by separating the core application logic from the binary entrypoint. For example:

```
my-http-server/
├── Cargo.toml
├── Dockerfile
├── docker-compose.yml
├── migrations/                  # Database migration files (if using Diesel)
├── src/
│   ├── lib.rs                   # Library crate – contains business logic, route handlers, DB logic, etc.
│   ├── main.rs                  # Minimal binary: sets up config and calls lib::run()
│   ├── config/                  # Configuration parsing and management (e.g., environment variables)
│   │   └── mod.rs
│   ├── routes/                  # HTTP route definitions (e.g., health, items)
│   │   ├── health.rs
│   │   └── items.rs
│   ├── handlers/                # Handler functions for each route
│   │   ├── health_handler.rs
│   │   └── items_handler.rs
│   ├── models/                  # Data models (e.g., database entities)
│   │   └── item.rs
│   ├── db/                      # Database access layer (connection pooling, queries)
│   │   └── mod.rs
│   └── errors/                  # Custom error types and error handling utilities
│       └── mod.rs
└── tests/                       # Integration tests (e.g., end‑to‑end API tests)
    ├── health_check.rs
    └── items_integration.rs
```

### Key Points in Structure:

- **Library vs Binary:**  
  – Keep your business logic and route definitions inside `lib.rs` so that integration tests (in the `tests/` directory) can import them as a crate.
- **Modular Organization:**  
  – Split functionality into modules (config, routes, handlers, models, db, errors) for better separation of concerns.
- **Configuration & Secrets:**  
  – Use a dedicated module (or crate like `config`) to read environment variables and manage configuration.
- **Testing:**  
  – Write integration tests in the `tests/` folder that spin up the server (possibly on a random port) and issue HTTP requests using a client like `reqwest`.

## 5. Docker & Deployment

### Dockerfile Example (Multi‑Stage Build)

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the application in release mode
FROM rust:1.68 as builder
WORKDIR /usr/src/my-http-server
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release

# Stage 2: Create a minimal image
FROM debian:buster-slim
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ca-certificates && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
COPY --from=builder /usr/src/my-http-server/target/release/my-http-server /usr/local/bin/my-http-server
CMD ["my-http-server"]
```

### docker-compose.yml Example

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db:5432/mydb
      - RUST_LOG=info
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: mydb
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  pgdata:
```

## 6. Summary

This specification gives you a learning path that starts with a minimal base server (a couple of routes and simple database access) and then expands into production-grade features (security, rate limiting, API docs, advanced logging, etc.). The suggested project structure separates concerns and facilitates testing, while the Docker configuration helps simulate a production-like environment.

By following this spec and gradually extending your server, you’ll build not only a functional HTTP API but also gain the skills and architectural insights needed for production-level Rust web services.
